## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://khyaran.github.io/NFT-preview-card-component-solution/](https://khyaran.github.io/NFT-preview-card-component-solution/)

## My process

Everything was straight forward until I needed to add the hover effects, this was my first time using them so I had to do some research, I have no idea if my solutions were any good but they do the job.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I dabbled a bit into how position absolute and relative work although I still don't fully understand it.
Learned how to make use of pseudo-elements to create visuals.
The use of relative values instead of absolute ones for responsiveness.

### Continued development

I definitely need to work more on how to position elements.
